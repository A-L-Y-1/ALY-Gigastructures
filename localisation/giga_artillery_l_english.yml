    giga_tech_asteroid_artillery_desc:0 "The ever-growing size of modern warships means that starbases will simply not cut it anymore when it comes to defending our territory, but logistical problems prevent a conventional defensive platform from getting too large. However, by embedding a defensive installation into a large asteroid, we can simultaneously solve the problems posed by recoil, as well as those caused by maintenance issue by integrating the structure's internals into the asteroid itself and mining it for resources whenever needed. This would effectively enable the construction of much larger and significantly more powerful defensive bastions."
