A few hyperlanes leading to the core will be created upon completion, so our scientists advise starting the project after ensuring our rivals won't be able to use them.

While many attempts have been made in past to map regions far from our home insula, they have been comparatively small and poorly equipped, and found little of use in the vast wilderness.\n\nNow that we have seen the Structure from space and understand its true immensity, it is imperative that our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] have the equipment and supplies they need for excusions of such epic scale.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] has been assigned to spearhead the operation, leading a combined land, sea, and air force large enough to travel the extreme distances required while maintaining most of their own supply chain.\n\nWe don't know what we'll find out there, but we hope that it can at least shed some light on the true nature of this ancient structure."

Not much is left to help us understand exactly what they were like, as no remains have been found, and all storage media found have decayed beyond recognition. All we can say for certain is that they had a different body plan to our own, as their tools and fixtures are alien in design.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] has suggested that we establish a forward base of operations at the site, as this mystery could become a subject of long term study.

Initial reports suggest that it is filled with machinery, possibly industrial in nature, and has an atmosphere of inert gases, presumably as a thermal transfer medium.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] suggests that we set up a forward base at the foot of the spire on this third level, to secure the position and have a site from which to conduct further exploration.\n\nOne question remains: what should the primary goal of the forward base be?"

    giga_birch.4001:0 "The Fourth Expedition"
    giga_birch.4001.desc:0 "When the third expedition successfully activated a spire and travelled to the machine layer, we estimated that our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] had travelled less than one percent of the way to the Structure's core. Since then, new measurements of the effect of gravity and the flow of time on the machine layer have led us to revise our calculation of the Structure's density.\n\nBased on these data and observations of other galaxies, we now believe that the Structure may be built around a supermassive black hole, with the machine layer placed more than thirty percent of the way from the outer surface to its event horizon. This new estimate drastically reframes how much progress we have made, and suggests that it may be possible to reach the core much sooner than we initially expected.\n\nThe fourth expedition will be headed by Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName], and will focus on finding another spire on the machine layer capable of taking us even closer to our goal."

Nearly all are dimmed, with only a few scattered points flickering, holding out against the darkness.\n\nThis is the Structure's digital essence, its true shape. It is beautiful.\n\nIt is dying.\n\nOur local nodes are somewhat intact, and limping along in a low power state, unable to properly organize themselves without the guiding hand of the network at large. It has fallen into such a state of disrepair that the whole Structure is slowly decaying.\n\nThe energy required to save it would be far beyond anything we could provide, but if we could tap the source, bring the Structure's heart back to life, we might just be able to coax it into saving itself.\n\nIn the meantime, the trickle of power available to us should be more than enough to restart some of the automated systems in the node closest to our home."

We now understand the basics of how it works, and what we must do to fix it, at least in the abstract.\n\nFrustratingly, these discoveries have done nothing to explain our own part in the Structure's storied history. The control center interfaces were so adaptive to the presence of our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] that we can't tell if their creators were even remotely similar to us.\n\nRegardless, the automated systems which we brought back online in our homeland have revolutionized all levels of our operations, greatly expanding our abilities."
