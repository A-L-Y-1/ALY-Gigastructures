A few hyperlanes leading to the core will be created upon completion, so our scientists advise starting the project after ensuring our rivals won't be able to use them.

    # expedition 1
    giga_birch.1001:0 "The First Expedition"
    giga_birch.1001.desc:0 "Today marks the departure date of our first major exploratory operation to discover a functional transit spire, and through it the origins of our homeworld. While many attempts have been made in past to map regions far from our home insula, they have been comparatively small and poorly equipped, and found little of use in the vast wilderness.\n\nNow that we have seen the Structure from space and understand its true immensity, it is imperative that our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] have the equipment and supplies they need for excusions of such epic scale.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] has been assigned to spearhead the operation, leading a combined land, sea, and air force large enough to travel the extreme distances required while maintaining most of their own supply chain.\n\nWe don't know what we'll find out there, but we hope that it can at least shed some light on the true nature of this ancient structure."
    giga_birch.1001.a:0 "We strike out into the darkness, in search of truth."

    giga_birch.1002:0 "Silent Ruins"
    giga_birch.1002.desc:0 "Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] reports that our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] have discovered the remains of a large settlement, arranged much like our own around one of the great support spires, which is unfortunately non-functional.\n\nBetween the worn down state of the ruins and how many structures appear to have been entirely buried by the silt-rains, our [GetArchaeologistPlural] estimate that the settlement has been abandoned for around 200 years.\n\nA more thorough investigation is underway, and should be ready to report back soon."
    giga_birch.1002.a:0 "Separated by space, and time."

    giga_birch.1003:0 "A Permanent Presence?"
    giga_birch.1003.desc:0 "The report on the ruined settlement discovered by our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] has arrived, and it does little to explain what we have seen.\n\nAccording to the expedition's head [GetArchaeologist], the civilization which once lived here was well established, and had a significant level of industrial infrastructure. Not much is left to help us understand exactly what they were like, as no remains have been found, and all storage media found have decayed beyond recognition. All we can say for certain is that they had a different body plan to our own, as their tools and fixtures are alien in design.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] has suggested that we establish a forward base of operations at the site, as this mystery could become a subject of long term study. [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetSheHeCap] [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetIsAre] also suggesting that we could use some of the less interesting sites to gather resources, either through recycling or land redevelopment."

    giga_birch.1004:0 "An Uncertain Future"
    giga_birch.1004.desc:0 "The discovery of an extinct civilization which seems to have followed a similar technological trajectory to our own has left us with a sense of uncertainty about our own permanence. We have the advantage of being able to access the space beyond the Structure's outer shell, but have yet to find a single functional spire through which to reach the lower levels. It is possible that none of them remain in an operational state, in which case we may never achieve our goal.\n\nWe must redouble our efforts. The next expedition will go further, learn more, and better able to repel anything which might threaten their mission."
    giga_birch.1004.a:0 "This forward base will be the first step of many."

    giga_birch.2001.desc:0 "The time has come to launch our second major expedition into the unknown, once again searching for a functional spire to access the lower layers of the Structure.\n\nBuilding upon our previous findings, our explorers will embark from the forward base established among the ruins discovered by the first expedition. Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] and [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetSheHe] team of [GigaGetExplorerPlural] are ready to take on any challenges which stand before them."

    giga_birch.2002:0 "Signs of Civilization"
    giga_birch.2002.desc:0 "Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] reports that our expedition has picked up radio signals indicative of an industrialized society, and has sent several camouflaged scouts ahead of the main convoy to investigate further.\n\nFrom what has been gleaned so far, they seem to be [giga_birch_expedition_2_species.GetSpeciesClassPlural] with a technological level significantly behind our own. They have many cities, several of which are built around spires, with structures built part way up their exterior primarily used for launching fixed wing aircraft over long distances.\n\nThere is no indication that they have detected our [GigaGetExplorerPlural], and every effort is being made to keep it that way."
    giga_birch.2002.a:0 "Gather as much information as possible."

    giga_birch.2003:0 "Contact!"
    giga_birch.2003.desc:0 "We have been spotted!\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] has sent an urgent transmission stating that the [giga_birch_expedition_2_species.GetSpeciesClass] species which the expedition was observing learned of their presence when one of the primitives' aircraft flew an unusually long distance in their direction, passing within our blackout zone and seeing the main convoy directly. The aircraft managed to escape, and sent a distress signal.\n\nWe are now receiving a message transmitted directly towards the convoy."
